1. About gExec

	gExec is a tool for running commands from a GUI. It presents the user with
	an entry field into which they can type their command and some toggle 
	buttons for specifying how the command should be run. (I.e. in a terminal).

	It features (normal, understandable, working) tab-completion, history list
	and options for running commands in a terminal emulator and/or the root 
	user (via gksu).

	gExec was created because I mainly use GTK programs, but I do not run
	Gnome (or at least not the panel). Instead I use WindowMaker. WindowMaker
	does have it's own run dialog, but it doesn't have tab-completion nor does
	it have a history, which is quite annoying. There are a bunch of 
	third-party program lauchers available, but at the moment of writing none
	of them do what I want. So came about gExec.

2. Installation

2.1. Requirements

	In order to compile gExec, you will need:

		* Gtk 2.0+ development headers
		* Glib 2.0+ development headers

	In order to run gExec, you will need:

		* Gtk 2.0+ dynamically loadable libraries.

2.2. Compiling

	Compiling gExec is easy. Just type 'make' at the command line in the 
	source directory.

2.3. Installation

	gExec is composed of only a single binary. You can copy it to any 
	destination on your system. May I suggest some directory that is in your
	path, like /usr/local/bin?

	Typing 'make install' at the command line in the source directory will do
	just that. It copies the binary to /usr/local/bin. That's it. Nothing more,
	nothing less.
	
2.4. Running

	From the --help output:

	Usage:
	  gexec [OPTION...] - Interactive run dialog

	Help Options:
	  -?, --help               Show help options
	  --help-all               Show all help options
	  --help-gtk               Show GTK+ Options

	Application Options:
	  -k, --keepopen           Keep gExec open after executing a command
	  --display=DISPLAY        X display to use

3. Configuration

	gExec has a few configuration options which are stored in the file

		$HOME/.gexec

	This file will automically be created if not present the first time
	gExec is run. It can contain three options:

	cmd_termemu=STRING   (default:  xterm -e %s  )
	cmd_su=STRING        (default:  gksu "%s"  )
	history_max=INT      (default:  20  )

	These options should be self-evident. Including a %s in the command
	will replace it with the command entered by the user in the program.
	
	Please be careful about the	construction of the commands for the 
	terminal emulator and the SU program. Not all programs will work 
	nicely together and some of	the commands need to be carefully 
	crafted taking in account quotes and other stuff. Frankly, changing
	any of these commands might open up a whole can of worms (which is 
	why there isn't a configuration display). Use at your own risk.

4.1. Known bugs

	This program is full of known bugs. Here are some of them:
	
	* Running a command in both a terminal and as root fails (depending
	  on the commands used).
	* Usage of deprecated gtk_combo.
	* Failure to execute a command via terminal or as root will go
	  unnoticed.
	
	Most of these bugs have a reason for not being fixed (and not even 
	because I'm just a lazy bastard). Mostly the reason is that the 
	bugs don't really matter in such a small program, solving the 
	problem opens up new problems or the problem isn't gExec's in the
	first place.
	
4.2. Credits

	I'd like to thank the following people for their help on gExec:

	* Me.
	* Anonymous guy who was really Mafkees!
	
	The following people have suggested useful features:

	* Jose Oswaldo (--keepopen option)
